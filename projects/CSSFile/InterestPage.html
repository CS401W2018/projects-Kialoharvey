        <h2>Color Selection for Styling</h2>
        <p><span id="important-text">Avatar: The Last Airbender</span> is one of my favorite TV shows because it's a story about four nations that control the elements of earth, fire, air, and water. It's full of epic battles, and profound themes of balance and harmony.</p>
        <p>The Fire Nation is the tribe that seeks to control all four nations, but the Avatar, who is the only one capable of bending all four elements, protects the other nations from the Fire Nation's oppression. The show's journey is one of leadership, and the importance of peace.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emphasized text color:</strong> I chose <span style="color: #2980b9;">light blue</span> to emphasize key elements such as links and highlighted text, as it's attention-grabbing but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li><strong>De-emphasized text color:</strong> I used <span style="color: #333333;">dark gray</span> for the body text, as it's easy on the eyes and doesn't distract from the main points.</li>
            <li><strong>Color selection process:</strong> I selected these colors because they offer a good balance of contrast and readability. I used a color palette tool online to find complementary colors that fit well together.</li>
        </ul>

            A relative link is a type of hyperlink that points to a location relative to the current document's location. For example, you can view my <a href="https://cs401w2018.github.io/projects-Kialoharvey/projects/Profile.html">Profile Page</a>. 
            An absolute link, on the other hand, points to a specific location using a full URL. Here's an external website about Avatar: The Last Airbender: <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-season-2">Avatar: The Last Airbender on Netflix</a>.

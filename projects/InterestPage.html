        <p>Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of my favorite TV shows because it's a story about four nations that control the elements of earth, fire, air, and water. It's full of epic battles, and profound themes of balance and harmony.</p>
        <p>The Fire Nation is the tribe that seeks to control all four nations, but the Avatar, who is the only one capable of bending all four elements, protects the other nations from the Fire Nation's oppression. The show's journey is one of leadership, and the importance of peace.</p>

            An absolute link, on the other hand, points to a specific location using a full URL. Here's an external website about Avatar: The Last Airbender: <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-season-2">Avatar: The Last Airbender on Netflix</a>.

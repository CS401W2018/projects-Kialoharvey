<h2>1. Internet</h2><p>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other using standardized protocols, primarily the Internet Protocol (IP).</p>
<h2>2. Web</h2>
<p>The Web (short for World Wide Web, or WWW) is a system of interlinked documents, resources, and multimedia that are accessed over the Internet. It is one of the most popular services available on the Internet, but it's not the same as the Internet itself.</p>
<h2>3. How are the internet and Web different?</h2>
<p>the Internet is the physical infrastructure and global network, while the Web is a specific service that uses the Internet to deliver websites and web-based content.</p>
<h2>4. ASCII and Unicode</h2>
<p>American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a set of digital codes representing letters, numerals, and other symbols, widely used as a standard format in the transfer of text between computers:<p>
<p>Unicode is an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs.</p>

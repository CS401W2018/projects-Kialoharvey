    <blockquote>"Success is not always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come."</blockquote>

    <p>What I admire most about the Roosters is their <strong>resilience and come-back mindset</strong> They always finding ways to stay at the top of the league. Their players <em>are of class</em>  and their dedication, skill, and determination. Watching the Roosters play is always <mark> a joyous feeling</mark>, especially when they pull off comebacks or dominate in key matches.</p>

    <p>My favorite moments with the Roosters often involve the intense clashes with arch-rivals, like the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The energy of those games is unmatched, and it always gets my adrenaline pumping! The feeling of watching them win feels like &hearts; and the passion of their supporters like &spades;.</p>

        <ol> <li>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.Block-level elements take up the full width available and always start on a new line. They stack vertically and expand to fit the container by default.Inline elements only take up as much width as their content requires and do not force a line break.</li>
<li>What is normal flow in HTML?Normal flow is the default layout behavior of HTML elements before any CSS styling like float, position, or display is applied.</li>
<li>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float? Float allows elements to "float" to the left or right of their container, causing text and other inline elements to wrap around the floated element. Clear float is necessary because floated elements are taken out of the normal flow, meaning they do not contribute to the height of their containing block.</li>
<li>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do? Relative position positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow. Absolute position positions an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed), or the document body if no ancestor is positioned. Fixed position positions an element relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in place even when the page is scrolled. </li>
<li>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?To create mobile-friendly navigation buttons, you can use responsive design by adjusting the layout with media queries so it works well on different screen sizes. For small screens, you can use a hamburger menu to save space. Make the buttons larger with enough padding and margins so they are easy to tap. Using flexbox helps to neatly arrange the navigation items and keep everything aligned properly.</li>
<li>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class? On canvas under lecture notes</li>
